# STUN example

To run the example please compile STUN before using the command

`cargo build --release`

This generates the binary files at the standard place for Rust
`../target/release/stun`. If your STUN executable is at a different
location, please replace`../target/release/stun` with the location
of the stun executable.

For generating the graph you need R installed and accessible in
the path.
